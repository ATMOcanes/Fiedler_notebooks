There is no Python to execute. No need to download it.  Just view it right here.\n\nThe important ipython notebooks to download are in the last section.\n\nThe official class website (for due dates, the posting of grades, official syllabus) is at http://canvas.ou.edu", "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": "## Installing Anaconda Python for Jupyter Notebooks\n\nYou will need your own installation of [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  Most likely you want 64-bit, unless your computer is ancient.\n\nIn METR 4323, we will use python via a [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org). (You are looking at such a notebook now)\n\nAt that site, you are welcome to click \"Try it in your browser\", and then \"Welcome_to_Python.ipynb\".\n\nHere is a  [video introduction to jupyter notebooks](https://youtu.be/e9cSF3eVQv0).  You just need\nto type `jupyter notebook` on the command line of your Windows|OSX|Linux computer, and the jupyter notebook opens in *your browser*.  That's right: the app that you use for web surfing will be your development environment for python.\n\nNote the terminology [jupyter versus ipython](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).  Here we learn that \"jupyter\" is the [language-agnostic part](https://ipython.org/) of the notebook, which can be used for several languages.\nSo, more accurately, we may say METR 4323 uses [ipython](http://ipython.org/) as the kernel in jupyter.", "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": "## Jupyter/Ipython warm up\n\nHere is a notebook on the level of my \"freshman\" Python course: \n[ScrabbleWords.ipynb](https://anaconda.org/bfiedler/scrabblewords).  \n**Click on \"Download\" and save it to your computer.**\nYou may want to save it in a directory/folder named `notebooks`, or something like that. \n\n\nThen, from your [Jupyter dashboard](https://youtu.be/e9cSF3eVQv0?t=5m0), open `ScrabbleWords.ipynb`.\n\nI make no claim that `ScrabbleWords.ipynb` is the ideal place to start for you.  \nYou may want to investigate [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).\n\nYou may also find my [matplotlib1.ipynb](https://anaconda.org/bfiedler/matplotlib1/notebook) useful.\n\nStudents in a previous semester enjoyed my [N005_CollatzConjecture](https://anaconda.org/bfiedler/n005_collatzconjecture)\n", "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": "## The course notebooks", "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": "No summaries are provided here (yet).
